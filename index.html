        choosing the right ac

      <p>
        acs come in three varieties — window, freestanding, and built-in.
        window acs enjoy popularity due to their affordability and ease of installation.
        the freestanding ones can easily be moved between different rooms but are much less efficient.
        as for the built-in acs, they are fixed to set locations on the walls but provide both hot and cold air; still, they can be quite expensive.
        each ac has a cooling capacity based on its intended room size and measured in btus.
        these values can range from 5,000 all the way up to 20,000 and are meant to be used in spaces as small as 150 square feet or as large as 1,500 respectively.
        while picking the right ac can be a challenge, we are here to help you at each step of the process.

      <p>
        taking care of your ac is very important.
        the outdoor units collect dirt and debris that gradually damage the systems unless cleaned regularly.
        the filter of the unit itself must also be replaced every few months as it accumulates dirt, pollutants, and allergens — all very harmful to your health.
        ac units also have various coils which will result in restricted airflow if not cleaned properly.
