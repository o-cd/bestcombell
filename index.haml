        choosing the right ac
    %td
      %p
        acs come in three varieties â€” window, freestanding, and built-in.
        window acs enjoy popularity due to their affordability and ease of installation,
        while freestanding ones can easily be moved between different rooms,
        although they are less efficient.
        the built-in acs, while being mounted on the walls, can provide both hot and cold air;
        and while they are more expensive, don't take up any windows space.
        it is also important to choose the right cooling capacity (btu) based on your room size.
        these range from 5,000 to 20,000 and are meant for spaces with dimensions from 150 square
        feet to 1,500.

        taking care of your ac unit is very important.
        the outdoor units collect dirt and debris that will damage the system if not cleaned regularly.
        the filter of the unit itself must also be replaced every few months as it accumulates the dirt, pollutants, and allergens, which are all harmful to your health.
        ac units also have various coils which will result in restricted airflow if not cleaned properly.
